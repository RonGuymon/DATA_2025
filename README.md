# DATA_2025
Files for presentations at DATA 2025 in Dallas.

## General Steps For Using Python
1. Click on a lab folder, and then cliuck on the .ipynb file.
2. Open them in Google Colab by slightly changing the URL by adding __tocolab__ after the https://github in https://github.com/RonGuymon/DATA_2025/blob/main/IBA%20Lab%201.3/Lab_1.3_Python_Code_and_Output_for_IDE.ipynb.
3. You can load the data directly from GitHub, so you'll need to replace the Excel file name with a link to the raw file on GitHub. You can find that name by  
  1. clicking on an Excel file, like Lab_1.3_Python_Data.xlsx,  
  2. copying the file address in the search bar, and  
  3. pasting the file address in the pd.read_excel function, and changing the "blob" part to "raw".
